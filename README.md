# Pebble Paper Model

I needed a [Pebble](http://getpebble.com) for my father's birthday but mine weren't shipped yet, so I had to come up with a [placeholder](https://twitter.com/thomas_jachmann/status/312902524980064257/photo/1):

# Assembly

What you need:

* paper
* cutter
* glue
* toothpicks to hold the straps in place

What you do:

1. print [pebble.pdf](https://github.com/thomasjachmann/pebble_paper_model/raw/master/pebble.pdf)
1. cut
1. glue
1. win

# Gotchas

I've created this printout for myself. No detailed instructions on how to fold are included, so you're on your own here. I's a completely closed model so the last flaps are quite tricky to glue together. Take care when inserting the toothpicks since that can ruin your model when you apply too much pressure. Be sure to drill the holes before you start gluing everything together.

# License

Do whatever you like with this, some form of attribution would be nice, though.

Concerning attribution, the images for the model have been taken from:

Thanks for those!

The actual measurements are taken from pebbles public [specs](https://github.com/pebble/pebble-3d/raw/master/PebbleSolid-20130103.pdf).
